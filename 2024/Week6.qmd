# Week 6: September 30, 2022

## Writing
- Discuss differences/similarities between 
    - parent distribution
    - sampling distribution
    - data distribution
- Where does 'probability distribution' fit in?

## Simulation
- Explore distribution of min, max, median, range
- 3 distributions - unimodal, skewed, crazy
- plotted on board
- which are parent, sampling, and data distributions?
- which are approximate? theoretical?

- What would have to be modified to explore sample size?

## Next week?
- Write definition you'd give your students of sampling distribution

- Talk to mentor - 3 dates for potential teaching in October (ideally before fall break)
